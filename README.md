# Create a page for all the Hogwarts houses

Make a page with four full-width sections: one for each Hogwarts house. When page loads, only one section should be visible. (Make it your favorite house.) Clicking other house names in the nav should hide the visible house and show the clicked one.

## General requirements

* Start by wireframing/sketching.
* Bootstrap is optional.

## Nav

* Make a spritemap of Hogwarts houses using Sass. (Originals included in repo.)
* Use the spritemap for the four nav items, which should just be images, no text.

## jQuery

* Use jQuery to capture the clicks on the nav.
* Clicking a nav item should change the class on the body so that the page content changes, to the house that's been clicked.
* It should also change the background color.

## Each house section should have:

* Some text. Feel free to use the [Harry Potter Wikia](http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Houses).
* 1 or more SVGs from [thenounproject.com](thenounproject.com).
* 1-3 icons from [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/). Just follow the insructions.
* A video, using [responsive tools](http://css-tricks.com/rundown-of-handling-flexible-media/)

## Use media queries to

* Make the SVG get bigger/smaller when window gets bigger/smaller.
* Marvel as you don't lose any resolution fidelity!

## Footer

* Include a footer giving credit to all the sites you stole content and assets from.
